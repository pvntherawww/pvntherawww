Welcome to my personal site, my name is Alexander Veniaminovich Pushkin, I am a young developer from Murmansk. I wrote my first website in the 8th grade, I really like to write code. Now I am 24 years old, since 17 I have been doing music and rap. I created this site to improve the efficiency of distributing my music and to make money because I am missing a hot dog. I really love to eat. I work in sound design, mixing, mastering, beat making and songwriting. I can also create games, websites and small applications. Experience is the most important thing for me. I'm going to start making my own video game soon. This will be my first startup project.
